                                   =========

This is a simple Lisp dialect written in Python.  It's main features are:

    o lazy evaluation
    o dynamic function scoping
    o first class functions
    o Python-like functionality
    o the ability to call Python functions and methods natively

It's goal is to be a simple "practice" language.  It is potentially even useful
thanks to interoperability with Python and Jython.  The PLY (Python Lex-Yacc)
module will be used for lexing and parsing.

See the Dr. Dobb's article I wrote about Squeamish:

The demo program "time_server" is a sockets based time server that will work
with IPv6 (given the correct Java SDK for Jython).  To run the demo
application, run:

    cd src
    make test                     		# Prep Python Lex-Yacc.
    jython squeamish ../demo/time_server.sqm &  # Start the server.
    telnet localhost 4444                       # Try connecting.
    kill %1					# Stop the server.
